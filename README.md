# What is OpenFlightHPC?

![](static/openflighthpc.png)

OpenFlight is an open-source initiative that aims to provide ***Knowledge***, ***Experience*** and ***Help***.
- ***Knowledge*** - The OpenFlight team have a lot of experience building HPC stacks on various platforms utilising many deployment tools, domain services and cluster tools. This has helped develop some core theory and concepts which are beneficial for the HPC community as a whole.
- ***Experience*** - Through testing and deployment of various solutions OpenFlight has gained experience which are documented as reviews of various methodologies and tools. 
- ***Help*** - No HPC stack is ever the same so OpenFlight provides forums to provide assistance in choosing the right tools and solutions for different stacks. This is a great jumping off point for those wanting to discuss the benefits of various tools and processes.

Combining a comprehensive knowledgebase, examples of deployment methodologies, core concepts and a community ready to help - OpenFlight is the place to go for guidance.
