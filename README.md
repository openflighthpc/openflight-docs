# What is OpenFlightHPC?

![](static/openflighthpc.png)

OpenFlightHPC is an open-source initiative with the goal of developing an extensive knowledgebase and collection of tools for deploying a HPC stack. 

From selecting a platform to managing users to deploying applications, a HPC stack has many moving parts and considerations _but it doesn't have to be complicated_. 

Combining a comprehensive knowledgebase, tried and tested deployment methodologies, core concepts and a community ready to help - OpenFlightHPC is the place to go for guidance.
