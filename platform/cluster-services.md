# Configure Cluster Services

## Prerequisites

To setup cluster services, you will need to have the following information for your platform:
- `domain_name`: The FQDN for the internal subnet
- `head_ip`: The IP address of the head node
- `storage_ip`: The IP address of the storage node (note: in a simple setup, this can also be the head node)
- `login_ip`: The IP address of the login node (note: in a simple setup, this can also be the head node)
- `compute_ip_range`: The IP address range for the internal subnet
